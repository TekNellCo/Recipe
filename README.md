Notes :
This was a refresher as i havent coded in awhile. So it is a bit of a mess. I left svg the stock colors because I wasnt focused on that. Overall im pleased with it. The page is not the best looking but it helped me practice some new skills I wanted to learn while giving me a refresher on old ones. Search bar/buttons are just cosmetic but have hover effects.

Things ive learned :
-use outline on before:after to help setup layout
-learned how to make 5 star rating system and highlight them while keeping hovered items highlighted even after clicking 
-learned how to use keyframes on CSS and did a little math to get the sliders running (although the code is probably atrocious)


Things i need to learn/practice :
-learn how to label elements better
-learn how to be able to change 5 stars to less stars
-learn how to pull in api images + recipes dynamically to populate cards
-practice more with keyframes and before::after
